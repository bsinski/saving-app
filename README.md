## About the project
Application allows user to create saving plans, update them with expenses and view how much money they are allowed to spend in given time period. The solution was implemented in the form of the Android application. It was created in Visual Studio using .NET platform. Code for the application was written in C# with additional using of XAML. Xamarin framework was used during development too. It supplied me with tools and libraries specifically used for developing mobile apps. Data visualisations were created using Microcharts library which was found and installed using NuGet package manager.
